The 2013 Sustainable Design Awards (SDA) is an annual, student-lead initiative aiming to inspire post-secondary students to approach their projects through the lens of sustainability (ecological, social, cultural, and economic). Each year, students are invited to develop and submit design projects. Submissions are critiqued by an expert panel of judges, and voted on by peers. There is a cash prize for the winning entry.
The concept started with the idea of nature as a closed loop. From there we played with the idea of an infinity symbol that was repeated twice, forming three closed loops—one for each word that define the event’s name. The final mark also makes reference to an ampersand. The identity is flexible and dynamic. We have defined a variety of options for  use with different types of media. We have designed it so that it can change and move on screen. This multitude of variations and perspectives is a direct reflection of the competition.
